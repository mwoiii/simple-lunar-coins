# ArtifactOfPrestige

## About

Implements the Artifact of Prestige into Risk of Rain 2 exactly as it appears in Risk of Rain Returns. Includes additional features from Returns, such as stacking shrine symbols and changing of the shrine symbol colour, which can be turned on and off for both when the artifact is active when it is not. These settings can all be adjusted through the BepInEx config, with support for Risk of Options as well.
