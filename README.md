# SimpleLunarCoins

## About

SimpleLunarCoins is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that, by default, tweaks the lunar coin system to be a per-run currency.

Players start with 5 lunar coins, and every enemy kill has a fixed 5% chance of dropping a coin. Coins are automatically gathered, with a new animation when a coin is dropped and a subtle audio cue.

## Roadmap

The roadmap to completion is as follows, subject to change if additional ideas are brought in:

✓ Lunar coins don't drop directly, instead go straight to player inventory

✓ Lunar coins drop chance is raised, and doesn't decrease

✓ Players have 5 starting coins

✓ Above features configurable

✓ Visual effect of lunar coin

✓ Coin drop sound effect

-Enable/disable coin sharing (all players receive dropped coins)

-Enable/disable manual coin pickup

-Enable/disable per-run system

-Lunar coin storage (as to not overwrite lunar coin count before the mod was installed)
