# SimpleLunarCoins

## About

SimpleLunarCoins is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that allows simple customisation of the lunar coins system in a way that doesn't directly affect the balance of lunar items themselves. The settings can be adjusted through the BepInEx config file, and Risk of Options is also supported.

By default, the mod turns lunar coins into a per-run currency that it automatically picked up with a nifty new effect.
