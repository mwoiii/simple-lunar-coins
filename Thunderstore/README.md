# About

SimpleLunarCoins provides simple config options to lunar coins, with the default settings turning them into a per-run currency that is automatically picked up.

Settings include:

-Initial Coin Chance: The starting % chance for a coin to be dropped

-Coin Chance Multiplier: The value that the coin chance is multiplied by after a coin is dropped

-Starting Coins: The number of coins that each player holds at the start of a run, if the 'Reset Coins Each Run' setting is enabled

-Distribute Coins: Whenever a lunar coin is picked up, a lunar coin is given to every player

-No Coin Droplets: Enemies no longer drop physical coins that need to be manually picked up, and instead are automatically picked up alongside a emitting a custom effect

-Reset Coins Each Run: Each player starts a run with the amount of coins specified in 'Starting Coins'

Bear in mind that using 'Reset Coins Each Run' will (currently) permanently overwrite the lunar coins of each player in the run.
