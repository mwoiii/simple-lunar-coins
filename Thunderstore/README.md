# SimpleLunarCoins

## About

SimpleLunarCoins is a mod that aims to provide subtle customisation of how lunar coins are handled without otherwise reworking any major gameplay elements. 

By default, coins are automatically picked up, distributed among all players, and coin pickups are replaced with a new effect of the enemy dropping said coin in the same fashion as gold. All of the aforementioned settings are customisable in the **BepInEx config file** or with **Risk of Options**, and a full list of the settings can be read below.

If you're looking for a mod that provides a full rework of the lunar coin system, including most of the changes this mod provides, check out [Ephemeral Coins](https://thunderstore.io/package/VarnaScelestus/Ephemeral_Coins/) instead.

## Customisation
At this point in time, the following settings are configurable:

* ***Initial Coin Chance***: The starting % chance for a coin to be dropped.

* ***Coin Chance Multiplier***: The value that the coin chance is multiplied by after a coin is dropped.

* ***Starting Coins***: The number of coins that each player holds at the start of a run, if the 'Reset Coins Each Run' setting is enabled.

* ***Distribute Coins***: Whenever a lunar coin is picked up, a lunar coin is given to every player.

* ***No Coin Droplets***: Enemies no longer drop physical coins that need to be manually picked up, and instead are 
automatically picked up alongside a emitting a custom effect.

* ***Reset Coins Each Run***: Each player starts a run with the amount of coins specified in 'Starting Coins'.
    * Bear in mind that using 'Reset Coins Each Run' will (currently) permanently overwrite the lunar coins of each player in the run.
