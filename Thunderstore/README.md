# About

This mod turns lunar coins into a per-run currency, where each player starts with a fixed amount and can gain further coins at a fixed drop rate. Coins no longer need to be directly picked up, and instead are visually dropped through a small animation and a subtle audio cue. If you are looking for something more, such as a full rebalance of lunar coins, check out Ephemeral Coins instead.

The starting coins, drop rate, and subsequent drop rate multiplier are currently configurable through r2modman. Further settings are to be implemented in the future, such as the ability to enable/disable coin distrubtion (i.e. everybody getting a coin when one is picked up), and enable/disable manually picking up coins.
